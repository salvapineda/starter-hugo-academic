title: Learning-based Improvement in State Estimation for Unobservable Systems
abstract: The task of state estimation faces a major challenge due to the
  inherent lack of real-time observability, as certain measurements can only be
  acquired with a delay. As a result, power systems are essentially unobservable
  in real time, indicating the existence of multiple states that result in
  identical values for the available measurements. Certain existing approaches
  utilize historical data to infer the relationship between real-time available
  measurements and the state. Other learning-based methods aim at generating the
  pseudo-measurements required to make the system observable. Our paper presents
  a methodology that utilizes the outcome of an unobservable state estimator to
  exploit information on the joint probability distribution between real-time
  available measurements and delayed ones. Through numerical simulations
  conducted on a realistic electricity network with insufficient real-time
  measurements, the proposed procedure showcases superior performance compared
  to existing state forecasting approaches and those relying on inferred
  pseudo-measurements.
