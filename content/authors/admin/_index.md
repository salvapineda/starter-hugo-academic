I am currently an Associate Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Málaga. I have previously worked at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen (2013-2016) and at the Center for Electric Power and Energy at the Technical University of Denmark (2011-2013). I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering in 2011 at the University of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) supervised by Prof. Antonio Conejo. The thesis titled "[Medium-term electricity trading for risk-averse power producers via stochastic programming](https://github.com/salvapineda/website/blob/main/DissertationSalvadorPineda.pdf)" proposes different stochastic mathematical models to determine the optimal strategy of a power producer participating in electricity derivatives markets. Previously, I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Málaga, Spain, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.
